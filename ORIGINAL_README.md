# BSDEX Ruby Challenge

BSDEX Ruby case study

Write a simple web service that provides RESTful endpoints to store page views, clicks and allow query by url, type and time period.

## Task

* Implement a simple web-service providing store and query functionalities for a given page's views and clicks. The querying endpoint(s) should provide the possibility of filtering and aggregating the data as specified above.

## Hints
* Please use SQLite for your database
* For the web-service you can use any Ruby framework as you prefer
* Submit your challenge as git repository starting with this README as initial commit

## Assessment Criteria

Given the time scope of the challenge, we don't expect you to write code you would consider production-ready. 
However, please try to submit your code well-factored, without needless duplication and follow good practices.
Leave short comments where you feel the need to mark left-out refactoring opportunities.

What we will look at:
* If your code fulfils the requirements
* How clean is your design and implementation, how easy it is to understand and maintain your code
* How you verified your software, if by automated tests or some other way
* What kind of documentation you ship with your code
